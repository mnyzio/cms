# CMS - Content Management System / Employee Management System

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT_License-green)](#license)
## Description
This app works in node.js and uses inquirer npm to take responses from the user based on which mySQL queries are performed. 

I build this project to help users manage employees, their roles, department, salary and mangers.
My main focus for this app was to gain more experience and hands on practice with mySQL.
